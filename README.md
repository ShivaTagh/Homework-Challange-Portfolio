### List of acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### The Process
In this homework I took inspiration from my previous homework and class materials and built on top of that to create my Portfolio. I added all requested information. changed up the back layout and margins so it can be visible and adjusted through various types of screens. The page contains a section about me, how to contact me, previous home work examples (skills) and a link to my github.All links on site work and all info is up to date.Added link to 3 images.
In orther to accomplish the challege, the following steps were done:
-Understand clearly the purpose of creating Portfolio webpage.
-Research sources to understand key concepts.
-Added profile pictures.
-Added links to the sections.
-Added image to each section of the developers app and hover over them.
-Resized the page or view the site on various screens and devices
